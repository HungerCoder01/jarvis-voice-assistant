## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project was created as a learning exercise.

I learned the core concepts and project idea from the
**CodeWithHarry YouTube channel**, and then implemented,
experimented, and extended the project on my own to
better understand:

- Speech recognition
- Text-to-speech systems
- API-based AI integration
- Python project structuring

All code in this repository was written by me while
learning and experimenting with these concepts.
